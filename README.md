# Open Source Safety: Driving Environment Reference Models
​
Here are published models of the driving environment for public viewing, comments and collaboration.
​
We continue to make progress and will occationally share design updates. The [wiki](https://github.com/woven-planet/opensafety-mbse/wiki) is the best place to start browsing to make sense of our models.
​
If you have comments, please post a [discussion](https://github.com/woven-planet/opensafety-mbse/discussions) topic, create an [issue](https://github.com/woven-planet/opensafety-mbse/issues), or send us an email and we'll take a look.
​
This is a new project and we are a small team, so your patience is appreciated while we get this beast booted up!
